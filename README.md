# Learn Your Marvel Characters

## Motivation

If your spouse or a loved one can't stop talking about Marvel, you're not alone.
You simply cannot keep up with all the super heroes and super villains, and what their powers are.
Whenever you find yourself lost in a conversation, do not be alarmed.
With the LYMC app, you can search and find any Marvel character that may come up.
Find out what they look like, what they do, and what their abilities are.

## Description

When you open the application, you will be presented with the LYMC Homepage. There is a place on the Home page where you will be greeted by some of Marvels most famous characters. You can search for any Marvel character on the Home screen.
The ability to build and view your profile can be accessed once you sign up or log in. You can save search results within your profile and store them there. Upon clicking on the link to your profile, you will see your saved characters.
